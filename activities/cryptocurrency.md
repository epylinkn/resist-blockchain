Cryptocurrency
==============

In this collaborative activity, we will perform all the major roles of the bitcoin network. Participants will simulate the purchase of digital and tangible goods and mining while developing an intuitive understanding of how blockchain technology facilitates everything.

Goal
----
1. Learn how cryptocurrencies and the blockchain work via role-playing.
2. Intuitively, build understanding about transactions, decentralization, transparency, mining and proof-of-work.

Setup
-----
In a blockchain network, typically an individual node can have multiple roles. Here, we will isolate three of the major roles.

Let's assume we have a group of 16.

- User - nodes with a wallet, i.e. nodes optimized for transactions
  - 8 individuals
- Miner - nodes optimized for mining
  - 2 individuals
  - 1 pool of 2 individuals
- Full-Blockchain Node - nodes optimized for P2P networking
  - 4 individuals

NOTE: Having an equal number of users and miners & full-nodes is nice in that the group can switch roles -- so everyone can experience being a user and vice-versa.

### Users
Your role is to make transactions with other users.

- Transact with each other freely. To make a transaction:
  1. Record the receiver's public-key on the post-it note
  2. Sign the post-it note (digital signature)
  3. If receiving, relay the information to the nearest full-blockchain node

### Setup
Each user begins with:
- A wallet (envelope)
  - with a pre-existing amount of bitcoin that the network already knows about (UTXO)
  - a 4-word public key, e.g. monkey-crayon-treble-snack
- Digital or Tangible goods: drugs, flights, video games, coffee, pizza, charity, etc.
- Post-it notes for making transactions to other parties

#### Miners
Your role is to beat out other miners to extend the blockchain.

- Take all incoming transactions.
- Jumble your mining rig until you get a number below the current difficulty, e.g. < 3.
- If you win
  - Reward yourself with coinbase transaction and transaction fees (via post-it notes)
  - Add the transactions to the blockchain and let everyone know

### Setup
Each miner begins with:
- A mining rig consiting of a jar with two dice inside
  - Option: Make different mining rigs and setup one pair to be a pool
- Post-it notes for recording rewarded coinbase and transaction fees

#### Full-Blockchain Node
Nodes are the first to be notified of transactions and are reponsible for propagating them. You keep the blockchain robust and decentralized.

- Validate transactions (post-its) and record them on sheet
  1. Make sure spender has enough bitcoin!
- Broadcast transactions to other nodes (and miners)

### Setup
Each node begins with:
- A sheet with existing state of system

#### Discussion
Choose a representative from each group. Let them start the discussion for that role and invite others to add to it.
- user
- individual miner
- pool miner
- full-blockchain node

- As a ______, what was your objective?
- What are some insights? Things you noticed?
- What was your optimal way of playing?
- Where did you feel unsure about the system?

### Key Takeaways
- Mining is not about mining new coin. It's about security and confirming transactions!
- Transactions are transparent.
- Decentralization! There is no central clearinghouse.
