Workshop: Blockchain for Social Good
====================================

Can an intuitive understanding of blockchain increase its use for social good?

Mission
-------

To make blockchain technology approachable to a wider audience with hopes that we begin to understand the significance of blockchain technology without complex computer science and mathematics. And in doing so, opening the doors to being critical of new technologies and utilizing new technologies for creative good.

Technology is not inherently good or bad. It's not too late to make blockchain a force for social good.

Why?
----

While there's a lot of hype and negative narratives surrounding blockchain technology, it has the potential to be the new web 3.0 and have deeply transformative effects on multiple aspects of our society. It allows for a new world of applications that can be decentralized, transparent, privacy-enabling, immutable, and ultra-democratic.

It's a platform that can give the individual choice, control, and participation.

Key Takeaways
-------------

* How can we be critical of emerging technology applied to social good?
* What questions should we ask during design to make an application good?

Intuitive Blockchain
--------------------

Blockchain is complex. Few people fully understand what's going on. Today, we'll spend time developing an intuitive understanding of the blockchain, that is understanding the blockchain without too much of the gory details.

### Activity: Cryptocurrency ([See Expanded Worksheet](./activities/cryptocurrency.md))

Building blockchain intuition through group activities. Put your computers and phones away, we're going to do this old school. (TODO: Can we really do this without computers? Propagating transactions to nodes might be difficult to do.)

Assume we have a group of 16.

- User (8 individuals)
  - Your role is to make transactions with other users.
  - Set each user up with a "wallet" & fake goods: drugs, flights, video games, coffee, pizza, charity, etc.
  - Let them transact with each other freely. As a transaction is made, share the transaction information with the nearest node.
- Miner (2 individuals; 1 pool of 2 individuals)
  - Mining -- can we emulate proof of work via sudokus? calculator / whiteboard / pen / pencil?
    - But how would we make the sudokus incorporate incoming transactions?
    - Have them permute transactions and calculate until they find a desired result
- Node (2 individuals)
  - Nodes are the first to be notified of transactions and are responsible for propagating them.
    - ie. recording transactions (post-its) and distributing to miners
  - Do we need this role? Yes, if we want to build intuition about decentralization and forks.

GOALS: understanding transactions, decentralization, transparency, mining and proof-of-work
TAKEAWAY: mining is not about mining new coin. it's about decentralization!

Q: Can we run this activity twice, switching roles the second time? Or perhaps the second run can be digital, with a bit more cryptography baked in, e.g. instead of calculators, teach them how to use node crypto

#### Discussion Questions

* Are transactions transparent? Are they public or private?
* Can we change or cheat? What does immutability mean?
* Who controls the blockchain? Is it distributed or decentralized?

Social Good
-----------

Here are some examples of this technology being used for social good.

How can you see this technology being used for social good?

What are some of the pitfalls of using this technology for social good? e.g. voting
  * Beyond the technology, what ethical considerations do we need to keep in mind
